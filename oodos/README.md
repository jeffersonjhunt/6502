# OODOS #

The One Off DOS: CP/M 3 for the OO-1. The plan and the decisions are in [hw/oodos.md](../hw/oodos.md); this
directory holds the work. So far, phase 0:

- [`diskdefs`](diskdefs): OODOS's disk formats for cpmtools.
- [`test/check_diskdefs.sh`](test/check_diskdefs.sh): checks them against cpmtools.
- [`spike/gwbasic/`](spike/gwbasic/): the GW-BASIC size spike.


## Drives on Linux ##

An OODOS drive is an image file on the SD card's FAT volume. cpmtools makes and reads them, given OODOS's
`diskdefs`: it reads `./diskdefs` before its own, so run it here or copy the file beside your images.

```
cd oodos
mkfs.cpm -f oodos-8m -t -L OODOS A.IMG      # -t: date stamps, as OODOS keeps them
cpmcp -f oodos-8m A.IMG HELLO.TXT 0:        # copy in, user 0
cpmls -f oodos-8m -F A.IMG                  # the directory with its stamps, as DIR [FULL]
cpmcp -f oodos-8m A.IMG 0:HELLO.TXT .       # copy out
fsck.cpm -f oodos-8m -n A.IMG               # check, changing nothing
```

| Format | Size | For |
|---|---|---|
| `oodos-8m` | 8 MB | the usual SD drive |
| `oodos-32m` | 32 MB | a large SD drive |
| `oodos-ram` | 128 KB | M:, the RAM disk (for tests) |
| `apple-do` | 140 KB | Apple CP/M disks (the SoftCard's), cpmtools's own |

Make drives with `-t`. Without it there are no SFCBs, so no date stamps, and OODOS's INITDIR would have to add
them.


## Checking the formats ##

`test/check_diskdefs.sh` makes each format with date stamps, checks the directory label and an SFCB in every
fourth entry, copies files in and out (users 0 and 3), checks the stamps cpmtools wrote, and runs `fsck.cpm`. It
installs cpmtools, so run it in a throwaway container:

```
docker run --rm -v "$(hostpath oodos):/o:ro" debian:bookworm sh /o/test/check_diskdefs.sh
```

It ends `PASS 15`. Checked with cpmtools 2.23 (Debian bookworm), 2026-10-26.
